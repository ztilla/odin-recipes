    <h2>How to Make the Perfect Cheesecake</h2>
    <p>
       <em> <strong>Looking for the perfect cheesecake recipe? </strong> It takes a bit of hubris to describe a recipe as "perfect," especially for something like cheesecake, for which everyone has their own personal favorite.

        But, this is simply the best, most wonderful cheesecake I have ever had, and have ever made. It is based on a master recipe, from the master of baking herself, Dorie Greenspan.
