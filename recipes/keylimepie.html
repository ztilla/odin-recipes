    <p>
        <em>I use Persian limes, otherwise known as ordinary supermarket limes, to make my “Key lime” pie. Unless you live in the Florida Keys, key limes are near impossible to find. Furthermore, they’re so tiny that you’d need to juice at least twenty of them for this recipe. No thank you! Ordinary limes make an exceptional Key lime pie, and they are a much better alternative to bracingly tart bottled Key lime juice. This pie tastes every bit as authentic as the real deal — plus it’s easier to make.

    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk        </li>
        <li>½ cup key lime juice        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated lime zest</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks        </li>
        <li>1 egg        </li>        
        <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust        </li>
        <li>2 egg whites        </li>
        <li>4 tablespoons white sugar        </li>
     
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, blend together condensed milk, lime juice and zest. Mix in egg yolks and whole egg.
             Pour mixture into crust, then cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To Make Meringue: In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until whites form stiff peaks. Spread meringue over pie, covering completely.
